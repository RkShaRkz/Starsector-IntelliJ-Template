# Vayra Merged (Vayra Sector, Vayra ShipPack and Kadur Remnant)

v3.3.3

## Description
This branch holds the latest dev version of VayraMerged mod, which fixes the mod for 0.97a and brings them back into one mod since 
a) none of them really worked well standalone (they either crashed the game or were missing dependencies from the other two mods) 
b) they were incompatible with 0.97a

Whichever the reason, now they work "fine".

The unorthodox usage of many branches on the same project **as different mod projects** rather than having an individual github repo for each of these branches is something I found appealing at the moment, 
and am checking to see how it'll turn out. Since all mods are essentially a similar thing, just a IntelliJ IDEA project, targetting dependencies in the same game folder.
