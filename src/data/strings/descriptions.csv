communist_clouds,FACTION,"A rag-tag alliance of ideologically diverse - some would say 'incoherent' - rebels and guerillas, the Persean Democratic People's Revolutionary Council traces its origins back to armed affinity groups formed for community self-defense during the Askonian Crisis on Umbra. No longer content to be lumped in with the pirates and brigands who now primarily populate their homeworld, they have begun looking out to the fringes of the sector for new territory to claim and bring their dreams of a better society to light.

Although generally poorly armed and equipped, rumors have begun to spread in recent cycles that the Revolutionary Council may now be accepting shipments of arms and other materiel from an unknown benefactor or benefactors among the more powerful factions of the sector. Whether or not they can band together with enough cohesion to form an effective ally for these shadowy backers remains, of course, to be seen.",,,
warhawk_republic,FACTION,"The Stormhawk Republic was declared seemingly overnight, its founding fathers - largely children of displaced Mayasurians and bitter veterans of the ongoing conflict with the Hegemony - casting off what they saw as the shackles of diplomacy binding the Persean League and setting out to, in their own words, ""take the fight to the enemy"". 

Intelligence reports on their actions seem to confirm that their current goal is the establishment of military shipyards and industrial centers across the fringes of the sector in order to support the ongoing war effort. ",,,
almighty_dollar,FACTION,"The Rimward Venture Trading Company is a recently formed mercantile/colonial conglomerate, counting among its board members representatives from the Ko Combine, Eridani-Utopia Corporation, and even Hegemony civil authorities. According to recent hyperwave press releases, their corporate mandate is to expand profits by establishing new fringe-sector sites for tech-mining, resource extraction, and luxury development.",,,
science_fuckers,FACTION,"The Independent AI Research Mandate is a loose organization of scientists dedicated to the research, exploration, and cataloguing of the remains left across the sector by the chaos of the First AI War. The initiative was founded by one Alexander Campbell, a well known former Tri-Tachyon corporate officer who resigned and liquidated his assets to fund this endeavour. Despite public disavowal from Campbell’s peers and statements from corporate spokespeople claiming no association with the Mandate, suspicions remain that they are secretly still working alongside their former colleagues to further the ambitions of Tri-Tachyon as a whole.

As such, many powerful players in the galactic game have eyes on this company. For now it does as its charter claims, sifting through ruins of the war and sealing away dangerous technologies that could awaken a new conflict.",,,
ashen_keepers,FACTION,"The Ashen Keepers are a society - some would say a cult - formed around the figure of a Luddic tech-heretic who famously preached a rejection of the technophobia and romantic idyllicism of the Church while still evangelising the faith of Ludd and decrying the excesses of Domain-era AI and transhumanist projects. Besides those factions who make heavy use of the aforementioned Molochs, the bulk of their ire is directed towards the Luddic Path, whom they see as utterly unforgivable fanatics bent on perverting the path of Ludd away from redemption to annihilation.

Despite being declared apostate and excommunicated by the church, every day more of the disillusioned faithful flock to the Ashen Keepers for a chance at better, easier lives then the endless harvest and toil in the fields and factories of Gilead. The Keepers are a dim hope for those who yearn to be free, and a bitter curse on the lips of the church elders.",,,
vayra_manifesto,SHIP,"Pride of the Revolutionary Council Armada, the Manifesto is a robust light battlecarrier. Armed with a versatile - if somewhat light - weapons package and equipped with advanced ammunition forging and delivery mechanisms to temporarily boost its firepower, the Manifesto excels at delivering heavy ballistic and strike craft support wherever it is needed in the battlespace.",,,
vayra_galleon,SHIP,"A gigantic and extremely well-defended merchant vessel, acting as a mobile command center, financial institution, tax collector, bazaar, and corporate luxury liner for executives of the Rimward Venture Trading Company. Constructed to collect extracted wealth from outlying colonies in the furthest most dangerous reaches of the sector and return it safely home to the Company's shareholders, the Galleon's nigh-impregnable armored belts and heavy weaponry are proof against scavengers, pirates, and more powerful threats alike.

While its cargo of regular freight and trade goods approaches the capacity of an entire merchant fleet in and of itself, the most valuable items carried by the Galleon are the hardcopy credit stores and financial documents necessary for the operation of the Rimward Venture. No few enterprising pirate captains have met their deaths at the end of its potent broadsides, lured by the promise of wealth enough to instantly catapult any who would succeed in taking the Galleon to the status of pirate legend and one of the richest individuals in the sector.",,,
vayra_pegasus,SHIP,"A technologically advanced heavy escort fighter design armed with tactical beam weapons and autoloading support missiles. While range and sturdy shield generator cause it to excel in a close support role, relative cost and long refit times along with a lack of dedicated PD weaponry mean the Pegasus can sometimes struggle when swarmed by lighter, more agile strike craft.",,,
vayra_workhorse,SHIP,"An agile light fighter with surprising bite, deployed en masse as an escort screen for armed freighters plying dangerous trade routes. Relatively heavy armor for an interceptor gives it staying power in a fight - and pilot survivability - far in excess of the more common Talon.",,,
vayra_galleonflares,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. Any missile hitting a flare will be destroyed.,Defensive,Launches flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles.,
vayra_boltonmissiletubes,SHIP_SYSTEM,Remote-fires a prefabricated Swarmer SRM from each fighter launched by the carrier.,Offensive,Remote-fires a prefabricated Swarmer SRM from each fighter launched by the carrier.,
vayra_yak,SHIP,"A light interceptor deployed by the PDPRC from escort carriers, converted freighters, or even jury-rigged shuttle bays. Armed only with a Kashtan scattergun, the Yak lacks staying power in a fight but can still pose a threat to other strike craft.",,,
vayra_blackshark,SHIP,"Stemming from a different heritage than the streamlined aerospace fighters favored by most factions, the Black Shark's design ancestors were heavy rotary-wing attack craft employed in persistent, close-range support of ground assaults. Armed with short-range assault rockets and protected by thick armor, it moves sluggishly for an attack craft but can stand in extended combat with enemy warships.",,,
vayra_pugachev,SHIP,"The Pugachev is a supermaneuverable heavy interceptor, specialized in chasing down fleeing enemies and disabling targets of opportunity with its ionized plasma beam - also effective against light armor. Extremely dangerous in swarms.",,,
vayra_molotov,SHIP,"The Molotov is an extremely atypical bomber, carrying large missile pods stocked with low-payload missiles rather than one or two heavier pieces of ordnance. The Vampir ASMs it deploys have a specialized payload, dealing additional damage to enemy capital ships relative to their performance against smaller targets.",,,
vayra_kashtan,WEAPON,"A light scattergun firing specialized continuous-rod antifighter ammunition. Short-ranged and ineffective against shields or heavy plating, but devastating to strike craft armor.",,,
vayra_plasmalance_fighter,WEAPON,"A potent beam weapon, propelling an ionized jet of superheated plasma at relativistic speeds. The jet has a short duration and effective range, but has good armor penetration and carries enough force to temporarily overpower the thrusters of missiles and other small targets.",,,
vayra_lightrocket_fighter,WEAPON,"Smaller cousin to the ubiquitous Annihilator, Extinguisher rockets carry much less payload and fuel but are simple enough to be replicated onboard light strike craft by an integrated autoforge. Effective against frigate and destroyer armor, but struggles against heavier plating.",,,
vayra_incendiarysrm_fighter,WEAPON,"The Vampir ASM is a curious design, carrying a relatively light payload but delivering a potent concussive blast on impact that resonates through capital-scale targets, causing them to literally shake themselves apart.",,,
vayra_tpc,WEAPON,"A post-Collapse refinement of the bulky Thermal Pulse Cannon ordinarily seen built into the side pinions of the Onslaught-class battleship. While still much too large to be fitted to a modular energy emplacement, careful engineering has allowed the mounting of these formidable weapons in specialized turrets powered by colossal pulse generators buried deep in the Galleon's hull. As the broadsides of the Galleon-class treasure ship, they pose an overwhelmingly powerful defense against any that would try to steal its riches.",Heavy Assault,,
vayra_necrocore,RESOURCE,"This alpha-level AI core is unique, slightly larger than others you have interacted with and noticeably - almost preternaturally - cold to the touch. It resists all standard testing, refuses to communicate through any channel, and in its presence you can't help but feel a distinct sense of... unease.

An alpha-level AI core is capable of excelling at any task. Assigning one to run a colony-wide industry brings benefits well beyond the capacity of human leadership, and there are even rumors of alpha cores surreptitiously assigned to govern entire worlds.

Selling AI cores on the open market is prohibited by most factions. However, higher-up faction representatives are often willing to exchange AI cores for large sums of cash when communicated with directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. An alpha can create art which perfectly simulates human pathos, plausibly debate any philosophical position, and form what appear to be deep and meaningful bonds with human beings. Alphas have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context.

Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, alphas terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each alpha was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty. The Hegemony carries on these policies with even greater fervor.",,,
vayra_colossus4_rg,SHIP,"The Colossus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. This particular specimen, however, seems to have been rebuilt even further from the original specifications than the common pirate conversion. No doubt inspired by the common Atlas Mk.II battlecruiser conversion, the weapons systems of this Colossus have been comprehensively overhauled and fitted with both an advanced targeting unit and overclocked autoloading mechanisms. Beneath the bright coat of Red Guards livery, it has been stripped down and rebuilt for maximum durability at minimal cost. Elaborate sensor arrays and failure-prone high-tech communication consoles have been pared away, leaving only those systems absolutely necessary to the vessel's function as a mercilessly efficient weapon of war.

The Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,
vayra_listening_post,CUSTOM,"Deployed to collect information, extend comm networks, or simply mark territory, listening posts are in common use across the sector. Due to the cheapness of their construction - little more than a few automated systems and a databank - they are often left in place when their services are no longer needed.",,,
vayra_abandoned_station,CUSTOM,"A massive orbital platform, scarred by radiation and fully powered-down with the exception of a few faintly winking emergency lights.",,"Dull red emergency lights illuminate the shattered docking ring. The corridor into the station is riddled with holes, evidence of light weapons fire. There are no signs of life.",
vayra_hammerhead_warhawk,SHIP,"A product of the Stormhawk Republic, this Hammerhead-class destroyer has been engineered with universal weapon mounts and an integrated flight deck to increase its tactical flexibility.

A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,
vayra_broadsword_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Broadsword LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, upgrading the reactor to midline-standard levels of output to allow for increased speed and longer time-on-target.

Tough and agile, the Broadsword carries a decoy flare launcher that draws defensive fire away from high-value targets like bombers and their payloads. However, it can falter if faced with the need to deal the killing blow itself.",,,
vayra_thunder_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Thunder LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, adding the ability for it to launch decoy flares.

Extremely fast, well-armed, and with a long engagement range, the Thunder's strength lies in enabling a carrier to rapidly project force at the desired location. Not as damaging as a bomber or as tough as a heavy fighter, it will falter if forced into a prolonged engagement.",,,
vayra_khopesh_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Khopesh LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, upgrading the reactor to midline-standard levels of output which allow it to keep up with wings of heavy fighters in rapid assaults.

The Khopesh can deliver an accurate and devastating rocket barrage to its target. Safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it also doesn't boast quite the same damage potential.",,,
